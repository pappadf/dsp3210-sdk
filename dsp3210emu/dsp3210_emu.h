/*
 * dsp3210_emu.h — reference emulator core for the AT&T DSP3210
 *
 * Sources of truth:
 *   - AT&T "DSP3210 Information Manual" (Sept 1991): chapter 4 instruction
 *     pages for per-instruction semantics and flag rules (Table 4-1),
 *     chapter 7 for the exception model, chapter 8 for the DAU and the
 *     DSP32 floating-point format, chapter 10 for encodings.
 *   - Hardware-verified encoding and behaviour notes recovered from real
 *     DSP3210 systems (Macintosh Quadra 840AV / Centris 660AV).
 *   - Encodings cross-checked against the companion reference disassembler
 *     (dsp3210dis), which was validated against Apple's shipped DSP code.
 *
 * Scope (version 1):
 *   - Complete instruction-set decode: every one of the 64 top-level
 *     opcodes is either executed or raises the documented illegal-opcode
 *     error (the seven patterns of IM §7.5.3.2).
 *   - CA (integer/branch/move) instructions are implemented to the letter
 *     of the manual, including delayed branches, do-loops, the hard-wired
 *     r0, pc = insn+8, and the 16-bit flag rules.
 *   - DA (floating-point) instructions: the decode and every addressing
 *     side effect (pointer post-modification, memory reads/writes,
 *     Z-field stores) are performed exactly.  The arithmetic itself
 *     comes in TWO drop-in implementations, chosen when the core is
 *     compiled (see dsp3210_emu.c):
 *       . the approximate DAU (default, libdsp3210emu.a) stands in host
 *         doubles for the 40-bit accumulators — at least as precise as
 *         hardware, but guard-bit rounding is not bit-exact;
 *       . the exact DAU (-DDSP3210_DAU_EXACT, libdsp3210emu-exact.a)
 *         models the datapath in integers: 40-bit accumulators, exact
 *         multiplier, truncating adder, documented rounding/saturation.
 *     Both cores expose this same header and the same ABI; portable
 *     code reads accumulators through the accessors below.
 *   - Exception model: the 16-entry vector table at evtp, error vs
 *     interrupt dispatch, emr masking, processing levels, ireturn with
 *     shadow restore, waiti, sftrst.  bkpt halts the emulator.
 *   - Peripherals (SIO, DMA, timer, BIO) are NOT modelled; their MMIO
 *     words behave as plain on-chip memory.
 *
 * Portable C99.  No global state; everything lives in dsp3210_emu.
